# Payment Process Diagram

This project contains a PlantUML diagram that illustrates the payment process involved in a typical transaction. The diagram includes the following key components arranged from left to right:

- **Cardholder**: The individual making the payment.
- **Merchant**: The business or service provider receiving the payment.
- **Acquirer**: The financial institution that processes card payments on behalf of the merchant.
- **Network/Brand**: The payment network (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) that facilitates the transaction.
- **Issuer**: The bank or financial institution that issued the card to the cardholder.

## Purpose

The purpose of this diagram is to provide a clear visual representation of the payment transaction flow, helping stakeholders understand the interactions between different entities involved in the payment process.

## Usage

To view the diagram, open the `diagrams/payment-process.plantuml` file using a PlantUML-compatible viewer or editor. You can also generate the diagram in various formats (e.g., PNG, SVG) using PlantUML tools.

Feel free to modify the diagram as needed to suit your specific requirements or to add additional details.
